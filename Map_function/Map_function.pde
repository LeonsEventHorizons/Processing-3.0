//MAP functiom. When your reading values in some range and you want to map those
//values to some other functional range, for example, reading values from a sensor in 
//the range of 65 and 324 to the range of colours of 0 and 255. You can use MAP() one
//to map one range to the other. Keep in mind what order you want to map the range to.
// This is important when plugging in the argumetns for the map() function.
//In the above example, the sensor values are the value to be mapped to colour.
//So the value comes first in argument of the map() function.
//PAGE 245
//In the scenario I just described, the value is the sensor reading. The current min and max is the sensorâ€™s
//range: 65 and 324. The new min and max is the range fill() expects: 0 and 255.
